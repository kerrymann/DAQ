# DAQ
Data-acquisition for small manned electric aircraft propulsion systems

It is designed to measure thrust of a motor propellor combination while attached to a truck in place of wind-tunnel testing.  This will allow the thrust and power of a given combination to be caharacterized over a range of airpseeds as opposed to just static thrust.
